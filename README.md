## What is the nextcloud api library?
> Use nextcloud features from inside your java application

## Currently implemented features
- Management of groups
- Folder management (Without access control)
- List shares and create new file shares (No way to delete/update shares atm.)
- Tested against nextCloud 27.0.1 server version, but should also work with older nextCloud and ownCloud systems

## Usage
- Add this dependency to your pom.xml file
```
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.a-schild</groupId>
	    <artifactId>nextcloud-java-api</artifactId>
	    <version>13.1.0</version>
	</dependency>
```

- The 13.x versions are now using the jakarta.xml binding stuff, to prevent problems with Java 11+
  No API changes have been made in v13, but at some places the XML stuff is exposed
  Which made it necessary to bump the major version number
- Create a NextcloudConnector instance and provide your server settings and authentification
- Now you can use the methods exposed to access your nextcloud instance
